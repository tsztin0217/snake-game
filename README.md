# Welcome to My Snake (Cat) game!
I chose to recreate the classic snake game for my browser game project because it was one of the very first games I played as a kid. My dad owned a Nokia 8850, and I remembered spending hours having fun with the simple yet addicting game on that tiny pixelated black and white screen! 

For this version, I wanted to add a little twist — instead of the traditional snake, you play as a cat chasing fish!

### How to play:
1. press *Start* button to start the game. 
2. Use arrow keys *← ↑ → ↓* to move your cat within the 10 x 10 grid.<br>
3. Eat the fish to grow longer and move faster!
4. Game over when:
    - Hit the edge of the grid
    - Turn into your own body in the opposite direction

After the game ends, you can either press *Reset* to read the instructions again or press *Play Again* to restart immediately!

While the game is still far from perfect and has limited features, I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed building it! 

## Current Bugs
- Food occasionally spawns on the cat's body which momentarily distorts the grid

## Future Improvements
- Make food respawn at a location different than the one that a cat segment is currently occupying 
- Light/dark mode
- Allow for mobile touch controls

## Technologies Used:
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
