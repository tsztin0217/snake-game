# Welcome to My Snake (Cat) game!
I chose to recreate the classic snake game for my browser game project because it was one of the very first games I played as a kid. My dad owned a Nokia 8850, and I remembered spending hours having fun with the simple yet addicting game on that tiny pixelated black and white screen! 

For this version, I wanted to add a little twist — instead of the traditional snake, you play as a cat chasing fish!

Link to game: https://tsztin0217.github.io/snake-game/

How to play:
1. press *Start* button to start the game. 
2. Use arrow keys ← ↑ → ↓ to move your cat within the 10 x 10 grid.<br>
3. Eat the fish to grow longer and move faster!
4. Game over when:
    - Hit the edge of the grid
    - Turn into your own body in the opposite direction

After the game ends, you can either reset to read the instructions again or press Play Again to restart immediately!

While the game is still far from perfect and has limited features, I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed building it!

## Current bugs
- When one segment of the snake's body passes the food it distorts the grid
- Still needs to create max level cap for winning condition

## Future Improvements
- light/dark mode
- allow for mobile touch controls

## Technologies Used:
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
